        <h3>Description</h3> 
        <p>This was one of the first cookie recipes I made as a kid.  As I have shared before, I was fully obsessed with cookbooks as a little girl. My Mom collected church cookbooks and I would go straight to the cookie recipes and beg my Mom to let me whip up a batch. I made this snickerdoodle cookie recipe 30 years ago and it is still the best I have ever tasted.</p>
        
        <p>This is such a popular Christmas cookie because I have yet to find anyone who doesn't love snickerdoodle cookies! When I used to teach a cooking school for kids, it was the first cookie I taught them to make because kids love them.  Whenever I make these cookies, they disappear so darn fast!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>1.5 Cups Sugar</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons Vanilla</li>
            <li>2.75 Cups Flower</li>
            <li>1.5 Teaspoons Cream of Tartar</li>
            <li>0.5 Teaspoons Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>0.25 Cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1.5 Tablespoons Cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon</li>
            <li>If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Roll into small balls until round and smooth. Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered. *To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle.*</li>
            <li>Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes. Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.</li>
        </ol>
