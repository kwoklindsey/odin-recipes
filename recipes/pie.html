        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In the pantheon of summertime pies, blueberry pie is right up there at the top. A good one should be packed to the brim with plump roly-poly berries, the flaky and buttery crust barely able to contain the jewel-like bounty. It should need only a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream to finish it off. Here is our recipe for a classic blueberry pie â€” no frills, no secret ingredients, just blueberries in all their summery glory.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>2/3 Cup Cold Land O Lakes Butter</li>
            <li>4-5 Tablespoons Cold Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 Cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup All-Purpose Flours</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Freshly Grated Lemon Zest</li>
            <li>1/4 Teaspoon Ground Nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon</li>
            <li>5 Cubs Thawed Frozen Blueberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Combine 2 cups flour and salt in bowl; cut in butter with pastry blender or fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in enough water with fork just until flour is moistened</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Shape each half into ball; flatten slightly. Wrap 1 dough ball in  plastic food wrap; refrigerate. Roll out remaining dough ball on lightly floured surface into 12-inch circle. Fold into quarters. Place dough into ungreased 8-inch pie pan; unfold, pressing firmly against bottom and sides. Trim crust to 1/2 inch from edge of pan.</li>
            <li>Combine sugar, 1/2 cup flour, lemon zest, cinnamon and nutmeg in bowl; mix well. Gently stir in blueberries. Spoon blueberry mixture into prepared pie crust.</li>
            <li>Roll out refrigerated dough ball on lightly floured surface into 12-inch circle. Place dough over filling. Seal, trim and crimp or flute edge. Cut 8-10 slits in crust. Cover edge of crust with 2-inch strip of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake 35 minutes; remove foil. Continue baking 10-20 minutes or until crust is lightly browned and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust.</li>
            <li>Cool pie at least 1 hour; serve warm. Store refrigerated</li>
        </ol>
